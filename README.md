The Goal of this application is to reduce the number of hospital/clinic visits during a pandemic for people who do not truly need it. This results in lower spread due to less movement and less risk to frontline workers.

This application is a web/mobile app that allows doctors and patients to followup their cases for COVID-19 and other pandemic treatment. Doctors follow up a patient's case, checking their symptoms, chatting with them, and providing recommendations.
